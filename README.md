## 🚀 Overview
**SmartDrive** provides a modern alternative to traditional cloud storage systems such as Google Drive or Dropbox.  
Built with **Next.js**, **Convex**, and **AI-powered modules**, it offers users a **smarter**, **context-aware**, and **high-performance** cloud experience.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Enable **secure and scalable** file storage  
- Provide **AI-powered automation** for tagging and organization  
- Support **semantic and voice-based search**  
- Offer **real-time synchronization** across devices  

---

## 🌟 Features
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** – via Clerk (supports MFA & OAuth)  
- 🧠 **AI-Based File Tagging** – automatic classification and metadata generation  
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** – find files using natural language (e.g., “Find my April invoice”)  
- 🎙️ **Voice Search (Optional)** – powered by Whisper / Browser API  
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage** – backed by Supabase or AWS S3  
- ⚡ **Serverless Backend** – built with Convex for real-time state sync  
- 🧩 **Responsive UI** – crafted using Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN  
- 🚀 **CI/CD Deployment** – hosted on Vercel with optional Docker support  

---

## 🧩 System Architecture
SmartDrive’s architecture is **modular**, **serverless**, and optimized for scalability and real-time interaction.

##  Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN | Interactive, modern, and responsive UI |
| **Backend** | Convex (Serverless), TypeScript | Real-time API and business logic |
| **Database** | Convex Data Layer | Metadata and AI tag storage |
| **Storage** | Supabase / AWS S3 | Cloud object storage |
| **AI / ML** | OpenAI Embeddings, TensorFlow/Keras, Pinecone/FAISS | AI tagging & semantic search |
| **Authentication** | Clerk, JWT (optional) | Secure login and access control |
| **Deployment** | Vercel, Docker (optional) | CI/CD and cloud scalability |

---

##  Detailed Workflow (Improved Methodology)

### 1️⃣ User Authentication
- User logs in securely through **Clerk** (supports social login & MFA).
- Session data is validated, and tokens (JWT) manage secure access.

### 2️⃣ File Upload & Storage
- User uploads files through the web interface.
- The file is validated by **Convex API** and stored in **Supabase/S3**.
- Metadata and initial tags are stored in **Convex Data Layer**.

### 3️⃣ AI Processing
- **OpenAI Embeddings** extract semantic meaning from file content.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** auto-classify images and documents.
- Generated AI tags are saved for organization and search.

### 4️⃣ Intelligent Search
- Users can search with **natural language or voice**.
- **Pinecone/FAISS** performs vector-similarity search on embeddings.
- Relevant results are returned instantly.

### 5️⃣ Real-Time Updates
- Convex automatically syncs file changes (upload/edit/delete) across connected clients.

### 6️⃣ Deployment & Delivery
- Frontend and backend are deployed on **Vercel** with integrated CI/CD.
- **Docker containers** provide consistent builds across environments.
